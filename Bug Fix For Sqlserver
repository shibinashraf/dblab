ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)


It happens when your password is missing.

Steps to change the password when you have forgotten it:

Stop MySQL Server (on Linux):

sudo systemctl stop mysql

Start the database without loading the grant tables or enabling networking:

sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
The ampersand at the end of this command will make this process run in the background, so you can continue to use your terminal and run mysql -u root (as root). It will not ask for a password.

If you get error like as below:

2018-02-12T08:57:39.826071Z mysqld_safe Directory '/var/run/mysqld' for UNIX
socket file don't exists.
mysql -u root
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
'/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
[1]+  Exit 1
Make MySQL service directory.

sudo mkdir /var/run/mysqld
Give MySQL user permission to write to the service directory.

sudo chown mysql: /var/run/mysqld
Run the same command in step 2 to run MySQL in background.

Run mysql -u root. You will get the MySQL console without entering a password.

Run these commands

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
For MySQL 5.7.6 and newer

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
For MySQL 5.7.5 and older

SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('new_password');
If the ALTER USER command doesn't work use:

UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('new_password')     WHERE User = 'root' AND Host = 'localhost';
Now exit

To stop the instance started manually:

sudo kill `cat /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid`
Restart MySQL

sudo systemctl start mysql
